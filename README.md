# grammpy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PatrikValkovic/grammpy-transforms.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/PatrikValkovic/grammpy-transforms) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/PatrikValkovic/grammpy-transforms/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://coveralls.io/github/PatrikValkovic/grammpy-transforms?branch=dev)

Package for transforming grammpy grammars. 

Currently only small subset of operations are implement.

Subset of methods for each type of grammar will be stored in separate object (currently only ContextFree is supported).

For each method, you can decide to modify or copy the grammar. Default behaviour is to copy grammar before each modification.
You can disable it for every method by passing `transform_grammar=True` as parameter.


## Regular grammars

Not implemented.

## Context-Free grammars

Only methods allowing to transform grammar into Chomsky normal form.

#### Removing of useless symbols

Including removing of unreachable symbols and symbols, thats not generate.

```python
from grammpy_transforms import ContextFree

new_g = ContextFree.remove_unreachable_symbols(g)
new_g = ContextFree.remove_nongenerating_nonterminals(g)
new_g = ContextFree.remove_useless_symbols(g)
ContextFree.is_grammar_generating(g)
```

#### Epsilon rules elimination

Method create new rules that will replace rules with nonterminal rewritable to epsilon rule.
You can also only search  for nonterminals, that are in rule with epsilon on the right side.

```python
from grammpy import *
from grammpy_transforms import ContextFree

class OldRules(Rule):
    rules = [([A], [B, C]), ([B], [EPS])]

ContextFree.find_nonterminals_rewritable_to_epsilon(g) # list of nonterminals
new_g = ContextFree.remove_rules_with_epsilon(g)

class NewRules(Rule):
    rules = [([A], [B, C]), ([A], [C])]
    
assert new_g.have_rule(NewRules) is True
```

Library creating own type of rule, so you can backtrack the changes.
The type is `ContextFree.EpsilonRemovedRule`.

```python
class CreatedRule(Rule):
    rule = ([A], [C])

created = new_g.get_rule(CreatedRule)
assert created.from_rule.rule == ([A], [B, C])
assert created.replace_index == 0
assert issubclass(created, ContextFree.EpsilonRemovedRule)
```

#### Removing of unit rules

As with epsilon rules removing, method for removing unit rules create new ones as so as removing invalid ones.
You can transform the grammar or just find reachable symbols.

```python
from grammpy import *
from grammpy_transforms import ContextFree

class OldRules(Rule):
    rules = [([A], [B]), ([B], [C]), ([B], [0]), ([C], [1])]

reach = ContextFree.find_nonterminals_reachable_by_unit_rules(g) # instance of ContextFree.UnitSymbolRechablingResults
assert reach.reach(A, B) is True
assert reach.reachables(A) == [A, B, C]
path = reach.path_rules(B, C) # list of unit rules
assert path[0].rule == ([B], [C])

new_g = ContextFree.remove_unit_rules(g)

class NewRules(Rule):
    rules = [([A], [0]), ([A], [1]), ([B], [0]), ([C], [1])]
    
assert new_g.have_rule(NewRules) is True
```

Method creates own type of rule (`ContextFree.ReducedUnitRule`) and you can backtrack the tranformations.

```python
class Ato1Rule(Rule): 
    rule=([A], [1])

created = new_g.get_rule(Ato1Rule)
assert created.by_rules[0].rule == ([A], [B])
assert created.by_rules[1].rule == ([B], [C])
assert created.end_rule.rule == ([C], [1])
```

#### Transformation to Chomsky normal form

Method transfer grammar into Chomsky normal form.

This operations create a lot of own types to allow easy backtracking of transformations.

Base classes are `ContextFree.ChomskyNonterminal` and `ContextFree.ChomskyRule`, that are base classes for other.

As nonterminals method use `ContextFree.ChomskyTermNonterminal` that represent nonterminal rewritable to terminal (A->a). Nonterminal have property `for_term`, where it stores terminal (as Terminal class).
Second class is `ContextFree.ChomskyGroupNonterminal`, that represent group of symbols (for example in rule A->BCD will this nonterminal represent CD). This nonterminal have property `group`, where it stores list of symbols, that represent.

For rules method create list of classes, where each class have different meaning:
- `ContextFree.ChomskySplitRule`: Represent rule, that was split to contain only two symbols. In property `from_rule` is stored original rule.
- `ContextFree.ChomskyRestRule`: Represent right part after splitting of rule. As previous, in `from_rule` property is stored original rule. 
When splitting, ChomskySplitRule and ChomskyRestRule represent original whole rule: `A->BCDE ==> A->BX and X->CDE`.
- `ContextFree.ChomskyTerminalReplaceRule`: This class is used in situations, where rule contains nonterminal with terminal. Rule is transformed into state, where terminal is replace with nonterminal rewritable to that terminal.
Class have `from_rule` property that stores original rule and `replace_index` property, that indicate which terminal were replace.
- `ContextFree.ChomskyTermRule`: It is class for rule, that directly rewrite nonterminal to terminal.


## Context grammars

Not implemented.

## Unrestricted grammars

Not implemented.

## Roadmap

Currently only small subset of operations are implemented.

Library should at least support these operations:
- Transform of grammar into valid LL(k) grammar
- Removing of recursion
- Transformations into another representation (like regular grammar to state machine), but this will be probably in separate package.
