# Grammpy

Welcome to the Grammpy library documentation.

To know how to handle the grammar, look at [grammar documentation](grammars.md). This document describes how to define grammar and how to manipulate with it.

Transformations are operations that in most cases transform rules into different forms. In this sub-packages you can find transformations to prepare grammar for CYK or LL grammars. See [transformation documentation](transforms.md) for more info.

Finally, to know more about parsers itself, see [parsers documentation](parsers.md). This sub-package contains operations related to CYK, LL(k), and more.

Finally, there is set of helper methods to traverse and manipulate the grammar or the resulting abstract syntactic tree. Visit [helper documentation](helpers.md) to see more.
