# Grammpy

Welcome to the Grammpy library documentation.

To know how to handle the grammar, look at [grammar documentation](grammars.md).

To know more about the transformations, see [transformation documentation](transforms.md).

Finally, to know more about parsers see [parsers documentation](parsers.md).

The library defined helper methods to traverse and manipulate the grammar or the tree.
You can see [helper documentation](helpers.md) to see more.
